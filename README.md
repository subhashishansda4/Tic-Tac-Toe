## Introduction
Built an app for **2 users** based on the game **Tic Tac Toe** for fun and recreational purpose

### Tic Tac Toe
Tic-tac-toe is a two-player game played on a 3x3 grid. Players take turns placing their marks (usually X's and O's) in one of the empty square

The first player to get three of their marks in a row (horizontally, vertically, or diagonally) wins the game. If all nine squares are filled and neither player has three in a row, the game is a tie
